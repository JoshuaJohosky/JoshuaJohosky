# Joshua Johosky | Systems Architect

**"The Architect of the Future is the one who can bridge the gap between theoretical symbolic logic and real-world infrastructure."**

I specialize in building high-fidelity frameworks that navigate the intersection of human-AI transition, regional economic sovereignty, and advanced physical logistics. My work represents a twenty-year convergence of cognitive mapping and systems engineering, reframing neurodivergent cognitive architectures as strategic systems assets.

## 🛰️ Technical Philosophy: The Safe Harbor Protocol
I operate under a "Safe Harbor" protocol, maintaining a clear distinction between **Public Strategic Signals** (documentation, whitepapers, and frameworks) and **Proprietary Logic Engines** (manifold math, private databases, and experimental code). This ensures that intellectual property is protected while providing high-fidelity transparency to partners and stakeholders.
